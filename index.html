                    <p>
                        I am a technology enthusiast in love with innovation. I love exploring and finding out the 'why' and 'how' of technology.
                        <br>
                        I love software engineering and programming. P.S it's just a fancy way of bossing computers telling them what to do.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I find great interest in topics such as artificial intelligence and computer security.
                        <br>
                        When I`m not programming, I love reading books and articles on computer science and technology.
                        <br>
                        I enjoy taking a walk or hanging out with friends during my free time. I also like watching movies and animations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once in not so often, I engage in works of art such as drawing and composing poems.I also love frisbee and badminton but I barely play the games.

                        I developed my first application in April 2023 using C++.This was after watching a series of tutorials about the windows.h library.
                        <br>
                        The application was the tic-tac-toe or crosses and naughts game. I uploaded the code to github months later.
                        <br>
                        I went through the industrial training programme offered at the University in May and June that same year.During this period, we 
                        were introduced to desktop programming using java and javaFX, we were also introduced to android application development using java.
                        <br>
                        I went further into android devepment as from august that year. As a result, I created a chat application using firebase, 
                        an mp3 player for android, and late that December, I created an android version of the tic-tac-toe.
                        <br>
                        Early 2024, January through May to be specific, I did my third year school project. I created an offline android assistant 
                        using the vosk android library for speech recognition. I utilized native android libraries to accomplish tasks based on the 
                        decoded speech e.g Intents to start phone calls and send sms, ContentResolver to query the contacts database. 
                        I also uploaded the code to github.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have created several desktop applications using javaFX. These include one for visitor management.
                        <br>
                        Beginning may 2024, I indulged in front-end web development. Starting with this, my portfolio website, I have gained solid knowledge of javascript.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As from October last year, I have learnt back-end web development using Django and created several web apps.
                        <br>
                        I am currently learning back-end web development using Java springboot.
